OPEN is a game intended for children with physical or mental disability, sensory impairment or learning difficulty. The main theme of the game is Cause & Effect â€“ improving eye-hand coordination by clicking on different devices like switch, mouse or a touch screen. These activities help learning the linkage between cause and effect, from basic to progressive levels, by using all kinds of input devices.
